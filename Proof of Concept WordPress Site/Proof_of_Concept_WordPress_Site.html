**Marconi Law Firm WordPress Website Implementation**

This project involved creating a secure and functional WordPress website for Marconi Law Firm, LLC, with a focus on providing audit-ready documentation for future IT management.

- **Project Scope**: Designed and implemented a WordPress-based website hosted on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to meet Marconi Law Firm's requirements.
- **Technologies Used**: WordPress for content management, Apache and MySQL as part of the LAMP stack, Nginx for reverse proxy, Docker containers for application isolation, and Shield Security and Loginizer plugins for enhanced security.
- **Special Features**:
  - **Security Measures**: Implemented two-factor authentication, file permission hardening, and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the site from vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and brute-force attacks.
  - **Defense-in-Depth**: Utilized multiple layers of security, including password policies, regular software updates, and continuous monitoring of file permissions and traffic.
  - **Customization**: Configured WordPress on a custom network topology with Docker containers to separate application layers, providing flexibility and scalability for future growth.

This documentation provides in-depth steps on installation, configuration, and security practices to guide Marconi Law Firmâ€™s IT department in managing the website securely.
