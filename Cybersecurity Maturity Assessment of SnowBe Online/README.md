# SnowBe Online – Cybersecurity Maturity Case Study

## Overview

This project evaluated and enhanced the cybersecurity maturity of **SnowBe Online**, a $100M lifestyle brand with an online-first sales model and retail presence across the U.S. and Europe. Due to rapid growth and a laid-back culture, critical IT security controls were initially overlooked. After going public, SnowBe initiated efforts to improve its cybersecurity posture using industry-standard maturity models.

## Tools Used

- **Simple Maturity Model Graphic** – To visually map and rate SnowBe’s maturity across cybersecurity domains.  
- **CMMC Domains** – Defined the 17 critical cybersecurity domains for evaluation.  
- **Maturity Rating Levels** – Provided structured levels (1–5) to assess domain maturity and guide improvement priorities.

## Project Tasks

- **Assessment**: Conducted a review of SnowBe's current technical infrastructure across AWS, on-prem servers, desktops, laptops, and retail systems.
- **Maturity Ratings**: Applied the Simple Maturity Model to rate all 17 CMMC domains based on current practices using the Maturity Rating Levels tool.
- **Domain Prioritization**: Ranked the domains by importance, starting with System and Communications Protection (SC), System Integrity (SI), and Incident Response (IR).
- **In-Depth Analysis**: Selected and analyzed four high-priority domains:
  - SC (System and Communications Protection)
  - IR (Incident Response)
  - RM (Risk Management)
  - CM (Configuration Management)
- **Recommendations**: Outlined next steps and implementation strategies aligned to CMMC Level 2–3 practices, including encryption protocols, risk assessments, incident response plans, and secure configuration baselines.

## Outcomes

- Delivered a maturity model snapshot highlighting SnowBe's security strengths and gaps.
- Provided actionable steps to strengthen security without financial overhead.
- Reinforced the use of structured frameworks (like CMMC) for scaling cybersecurity efforts.
- Recommended the use of tools like RMM for ongoing monitoring and compliance tracking.
