# SnowBe Online â€“ Security Plan and Risk Management Framework

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive **Information Security Plan** for SnowBe Online, a fast-growing lifestyle brand that recently went public. The plan integrates technical safeguards, policy controls, and compliance strategies aligned with the NIST 800-53 Revision 5 framework and risk management best practices.

The work stems from a detailed case study that revealed SnowBeâ€™s rapid growth had outpaced its technical controls. As a result, a full review of IT operations was conducted to design and implement an effective security strategy.

## Scope

The plan applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors across SnowBe's AWS-based e-commerce infrastructure, physical storefronts in the U.S. and Europe, and on-premises systems. It covers:

- Digital assets (e.g., customer data, sales platform)
- Physical assets (e.g., servers, laptops, desktops)
- Network infrastructure and mobile access
- Software development and lifecycle practices

## Key Components

### ðŸ”’ Policies Implemented

- **Access Control (AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-15, AC-17, AC-19)** â€“ Managing user access, enforcing least privilege, and securing remote and mobile device connections.
- **Configuration Management (CM-3)** â€“ Governing system changes with documentation, testing, and version tracking.
- **Cryptography (SC-12, SC-13)** â€“ Implementing secure key management and encryption for stored and transmitted data.
- **Incident Response (IR-1)** â€“ Ensuring timely and effective response to security events.
- **System Integrity & Maintenance (SI-2, SI-7)** â€“ Applying patches, securing endpoints, and maintaining software/firmware integrity.
- **PCI Compliance (AC-1 PCI Policy)** â€“ Meeting the required controls for protecting payment card data.
- **Security Awareness (AT-2)** â€“ Training staff on cybersecurity hygiene and social engineering awareness.
- **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC-1)** â€“ Adopting secure coding and development practices guided by NIST SP 800-160 and SSDF.

### ðŸ›  Standards & Procedures

- **New Account Procedure**
- **Password Management and Standards**
- **Session Termination and Unsuccessful Logon Controls**
- **Software Patch Management**
- **CMMC Security Maturity Model Adoption**

## Risk Management Insights

Based on the SnowBe case study, the following recommendations were made:

- Upgrade firmware, OS patches, anti-virus, and backup systems.
- Implement stricter access controls across servers.
- Secure physical access to infrastructure (e.g., locked server rooms).
- Ensure PCI DSS compliance for online transactions.
- Monitor and archive login audit trails.
- Vet mobile devices for secure data access.

## Outcomes

- A complete security policy framework covering governance, technical, physical, and operational domains.
- Mapped policies to NIST 800-53 controls to support compliance and organizational risk reduction.
- A roadmap for maturity and security gap closure based on CMMC and RMF principles.
