# SnowBe Online Security Policies, Standards, Procedures, and Security Plan

This repository houses a comprehensive suite of security policies, procedures, and a detailed Security Plan designed to secure SnowBe Online’s digital infrastructure, ensure regulatory compliance, and protect sensitive data. Developed in alignment with industry standards like NIST SP 800-53 and PCI DSS, this collection defines structured approaches to safeguarding critical information assets across various operational areas.

## Project Highlights
- **Security Plan**: This strategic plan integrates the developed policies, standards, and procedures to outline SnowBe Online’s overall security approach. It addresses risk management, access control, compliance mandates, and incident response, providing a roadmap for implementing security best practices across the organization.
- **Access Control Policies**: A robust access control framework, including policies on Access Enforcement, Least Privilege, and Account Creation, ensures that resources are accessible only to authorized personnel, reinforcing data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Endpoint Security**: Defines standards for endpoint devices, enforcing antivirus requirements, routine security patching, and the least privilege principle to protect SnowBe Online’s network from unauthorized access.
- **Password and Authentication Management**: Sets high standards for password complexity, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure storage practices, minimizing vulnerabilities and bolstering authentication security throughout the organization.
- **Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance**: Outlines secure procedures for handling payment card data, encompassing storage, processing, and disposal requirements to maintain PCI DSS compliance and protect customer financial information.
- **Remote Work Security**: Supports the security of remote work by enforcing encryption, malware protection, and secure access protocols, ensuring that remote employees can access company resources safely.
- **Change Control Management**: Establishes a process for authorized and documented system changes, mitigating potential disruptions and security risks while ensuring accountability and compliance.

Each document clearly defines roles, responsibilities, and enforcement mechanisms, with exception protocols to ensure consistent and effective application. This project demonstrates expertise in cybersecurity policy creation, risk management, and regulatory adherence, showcasing practical application of cybersecurity principles essential for protecting a dynamic organization’s digital ecosystem.
